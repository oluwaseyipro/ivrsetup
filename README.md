# IVR SETUP
The pandemic has changed the way we work and relate with our customers. People now prefer to work remotely and customers looking for smart customer service.  Implementing an IVR system can give you that leverage.  With IVR, your staff can work remotely,  distribute calls among the agents, monitor their activities, and at the same time provide quality smart service to your customers.
